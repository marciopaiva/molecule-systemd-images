## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Method

Send security reports to: **security@[your-domain].com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Container Security

- **Base Images**: Only official distribution images
- **Updates**: Regular security updates via automated builds
- **Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Minimal Surface**: Only essential packages installed

### Build Security

- **Signed Images**: All images are signed
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic build process
- **Supply Chain**: Verified base image sources
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials

### Runtime Security

- **Non-Root User**: Ansible user for operations
- **Capabilities**: Minimal required capabilities
- **Read-Only**: Filesystem mounted read-only where possible
- **Network**: Restricted network access

## üîç Security Best Practices

### For Users

```yaml
# Use specific versions, not 'latest'
platforms:
  - name: test
    image: mpaivabarbosa/molecule-systemd-ubuntu:24.04
    
# Enable security options
security_opts:
  - no-new-privileges:true
  
# Use read-only root filesystem
read_only: true

# Drop unnecessary capabilities
cap_drop:
  - ALL
cap_add:
  - SYS_ADMIN  # Only if needed for systemd
```

### For Developers

```dockerfile
# Use specific base image versions
FROM ubuntu:24.04

# Don't run as root
USER ansible

# Remove package caches
RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Use COPY instead of ADD
COPY file.txt /path/
```

## üö´ Known Security Considerations

### Privileged Mode

These images require `privileged: true` for systemd:

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: test
    image: mpaivabarbosa/molecule-systemd-ubuntu:24.04
    privileged: true  # Required for systemd
```

**Risk**: Full host access
**Mitigation**: Use only in isolated test environments

### Systemd in Containers

**Risk**: Potential privilege escalation
**Mitigation**: 
- Use only for testing
- Never in production
- Isolated environments only

### EOL Distributions

**Risk**: Unpatched vulnerabilities
**Mitigation**:
- Clearly marked as EOL
- Use alternative repositories
- Regular security scanning

## üîß Security Configuration

### Recommended Molecule Configuration

```yaml
driver:
  name: containers
  
platforms:
  - name: test
    image: mpaivabarbosa/molecule-systemd-ubuntu:24.04
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro
    security_opts:
      - apparmor:unconfined
    tmpfs:
      - /run
      - /tmp
```

### Network Security

```yaml
# Restrict network access
networks:
  - name: molecule-test
    driver: bridge
    options:
      com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc: "false"
```

## üìä Vulnerability Scanning

### Automated Scanning

- **GitHub Actions**: Trivy security scanning
- **Schedule**: Weekly scans
- **Reporting**: Security advisories for critical issues

### Manual Scanning

```bash
# Scan specific image
trivy image mpaivabarbosa/molecule-systemd-ubuntu:24.04

# Scan for high/critical only
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL mpaivabarbosa/molecule-systemd-ubuntu:24.04
```

## üö® Security Incidents

### Response Process

1. **Immediate**: Stop using affected images
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Mitigation**: Deploy fixes or workarounds
4. **Communication**: Notify users via GitHub
5. **Prevention**: Improve security measures

### Incident History

No security incidents reported to date.
